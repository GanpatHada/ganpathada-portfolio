        Hi, I am Ganpat Hada a Full stack  Developer. I have been working on the MERN stack for about 4 months in this span I have developed multiple projects which helped me to enhance my skills. Yes, having your strong base really helps and hence I am open to adapting to whichever framework is required. While I was working on different tech stacks, to give a kick start to my career I also did some freelancing work which helped me to explore different domains like Shopify app development, DevOps and Securities.

        After all this, I joined Neog a Bootcamp for web developers, there I learned about React ecosystem, UI/UX, web performances, and tooling which helped me to grow overall, and equipped me with some of the latest technologies.

        I believe Project Based Learning is the best approach to learn anything. Hence, I've got projects in all the different technologies that I've learned over time.

        By the way, when I'm not coding, you'll find me playing guitar, or watching stand-ups, or playing chess :
