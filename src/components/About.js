        <p>Hi, I am Ganpat Hada a Full stack  Developer. I have been working on the MERN stack for about 4 months in this span I have developed multiple projects which helped me to enhance my skills. I am open to adapting to whichever framework is required. <br /><br />

          Before all this, I have learned c,c++ and java and did some competitive programming and dsa ,I also have projects in java swing using mysql and in c++ using file handling <br />

          I believe Project Based Learning is the best approach to learn anything. Hence, I've got projects in all the different technologies that I've learned over time. <br /><br />

          By the way, when I'm not coding, you'll find me painting,sketching, or listening songs :</p>
